Overall, based on the knowledge acquired from the work on the tutorials and labs in the past few weeks and the past and future research, the team believes that this is an optimal project, because it allows for the team to utilize the board to its limits and make something that the group would find both interesting, challenging and unique. Planning has been taken seriously, because the time is limited and the possibility of things going wrong is very high, so many levels of the project has been introduced, such as starting with the mask, if that works moving to face detection and if that works moving to mouth detection. This strategy allows having a working product, which could be showcased, at most stages of the project, which the team believes is extremely important.
